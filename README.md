> This is our project that was submitted to [HackFest 2020: Online](https://hackfest.dscadmu.org), a 48-hour hackathon organized by the Developer Student Club (DSC) Loyola. In which we managed to be in the top teams and became a part of the finalists.

## Live site :rocket:

The live site can be found [here](https://service-board.vercel.app/)

## Rebuild locally :hammer:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShaneMaglangit/service-board.git
```

2. **Setup firebase**

Create a firebase project and enable the email-password and google sign in methods for FirebaseAuth.
Update the firebase-config.js file with your firebase details.

3. **Install dependencies**

Once you have a working clone of the project, you may use the following command install the necessary dependencies.

4. **Start the project**

Once you have a working clone of the project, you may use the following command install the necessary dependencies.
